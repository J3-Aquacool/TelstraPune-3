Find the first occurrence of an element in an array: Given an array of integers and an element, write a function to find the first occurrence of the element in the array.


create empty variable x to store position
sort the given array in ascending order
iterate through each element in the array to search for the specific element
if match found, store it in the variable x
return the position stored in x
if match not found, continue iterating until match found

if match not found, return not found

define a function, it takes array and the target element
set vlaue of variable x as 0
create a for loop to iterate through the array
loop breaks if element found
stores position in x
checks if value of x is non-negative, then returns value of x 
if not found after iterating and checking full array, stores "not found" in x

assign values to arr and element to check if element present in array and return the position using def()
