Find the pair of elements in an array that add up to a given sum: Given an array of integers and a target sum, write a function to find the pair of elements in the array that add up to the target sum.

START

Step-1: Create variables to store the array and target sum
	int arr[];
	int tSum;

Step-2: Input the array and the target sum
	Input arr[];
	Input tSum;

Step-3: Create two pointers, one for the first element and one for the second element
	int p1;
	int p2;


Step-4: Check for every pair that is possible, start with index 0 and check by making pairs with every consecutive index and so on
	for(p1 =0; p1<length(arr[])-1; p1++):                          //Start with the first index and make pairs
	{
		for(p2 = p1 +1; p2<=length(arr[])-1; p2++): 		//check for every pair for the given pointer p1
			if(arr[p1] + arr[p2] == tSum):
				print(the pair is arr[p1],arr[p2])
				End
	}
Step-5:If we have checked for every pair possible then print(there is no such pair)

End
